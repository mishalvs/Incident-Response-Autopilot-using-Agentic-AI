# Incident Response Autopilot – ByteBlue

**Hackathon:** IBM Dev Day – AI Demystified  
**Team Members:** Harrison Jones, Mishal VS, Sharda Sah, Felix Kipkorir, Rahber Islam

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **AI-powered Incident Response Autopilot** built using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.  
It automates the **end-to-end incident response lifecycle**, including:

- Intake of natural language incident reports  
- Severity classification (P1, P2, P3)  
- Automated response actions (ticket creation, on-call notifications)  
- Structured reporting  

The solution reduces manual effort, ensures consistent triage, and improves operational efficiency.

## How It Works
1. User submits an incident description.  
2. **Intake Agent** extracts key information.  
3. **Triage Agent** assigns severity.  
4. **Orchestrator** executes workflows: ticket creation, notifications, and final reporting.
